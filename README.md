# Hyperspectral-Band-Selection-and-Classification
Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures extensive spectral data across narrow bands, enabling precise object identification in domains such as agriculture, environmental mon- itoring, and remote sensing. In this work, we enhance three baseline mod- els—TWCNN, ABCNN, and RLSBS—with advanced techniques aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency. Our inception- enhanced TWCNN model achieves the highest overall accuracy by effectively capturing spectral-spatial features, followed by the RLSBS model, which balances accuracy with computational efficiency, and our improved ABCNN model, which leverages self-attention for enhanced spectral relevance. Experimental eval- uations on benchmark HSI datasets reveals that our improved approaches outperform state-of-the-art models in classification accuracy and processing speed.
